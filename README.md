> A new place to watch videos, share your own, and build a community.

video sharing website with the goal of actually being enjoyable for content creators to use.  
will have a fair & open acceptable content policy, and hopefully a reasonable monetization system at some point.  

this project uses SvelteKit for the frontend,  
the site is hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/@PenguinSpy/Chorgle) and accessable at https://chorgle.ml
